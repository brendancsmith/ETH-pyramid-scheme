=======================

This project is an implementation of an Ethereum smart contract pyramid scheme. It includes a smart contract for the Ethereum blockchain, a Python interface to interact with the blockchain, and a web interface to facilitate user interactions.

The smart contract is written in Solidity and is deployed to the Ethereum blockchain. The Python interface uses the `web3` library to interact with the smart contract. The web interface is built using Flask and Jinja2.

Users can join the scheme by sending a certain amount of Ether to the smart contract. They can then refer friends to join the scheme, and earn a commission on their friends' earnings. Users can view their earnings and withdraw them at any time.

Getting Started
----------------
To get started with this project, you will need to have a blockchain environment set up, such as Ganache for a local blockchain or an actual Ethereum testnet/mainnet.

1. Deploy the smart contract using the `blockchain_interface.py`.
2. Start the Flask web server using `main.py`.
3. Interact with the web interface to join the scheme, refer friends, view and withdraw earnings.
